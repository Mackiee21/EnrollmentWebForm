# EnrollmentWebForm
Final Project for our ELDNET subject, it is a university's enrollment web form (admin-like) Currently still under development but I have a fully-working similar app, hosted on azure. this is just a copy of that website using js and express. The other one was built using asp.net mvc


I'm not good at Node js still but I have a little knowledge, basically I can perform crud operations, but I do not yet have the skills to apply some middleware and whatnot. only
the basic ones.


# What? Another App?
Yes, I have another app hosted on Azure, @https://ucbenrollmentwebform.azurewebsites.net/. Come take a look. (Not responsive not professionally built)
